# roblox downgrader

**maybe broken**

i think this is pretty obvious what it is.. <br>
it also lets you start your executor, and clears intel shader cache and %tmp% when starting executor or roblox <br>
must start roblox thru this script to make sure it doesn't update itself again <br>
oh, and you NEED bloxstrap/fishstrap.
